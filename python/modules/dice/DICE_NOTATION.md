**On Dice Notation:**

A dice is shared in the following format: XdY, with X being the amount of dice, and Y the amount of sides the dice have.
For example, 8d6 means eight six-sided dice are rolled, while 1d20 is one twenty-sided dice.
If the X value is missing, a 1 is assumed. d12 <==> 1d12.
A single number X may also be added, in which case they are represented as Xd1 tuple in the code, and in the code only.
